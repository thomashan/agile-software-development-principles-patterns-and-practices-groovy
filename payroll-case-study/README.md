# Payroll case study
I've tried to be true as possible to all source listings in both "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices" and
"Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#".
If I deviate away from the source it will be listed in ["Improvements and changes"](##Improvements and changes)

## Improvements and changes
* Use of optional in favour of null object pattern
* I've tried to dissect the tests as finely as possible to be clear about the intent and unit under tests
* Pushed many tests from Payroll to lower level tests (e.g. PaymentClassification)
* Get rid of Paycheck.getField method

## Suggestions
* use different data store
    * object database
    * relational database
    * flat file
    * nosql database
        * column
        * key-value
        * document
        * graph
* use different web frameworks
    * zk
    * polymer
    * react
    * vue
    * echo
    * grails
    * micronaut
    * spring boot
    * JHipster
    * spark
